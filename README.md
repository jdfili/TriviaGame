# TriviaGame

This is a Utah Jazz related trivia game! Using jquery, one question is displayed at a time, and a countdown is started. Depending on whether the user guesses right, wrong, or doesn't guess at all, a different response is given at the end of the timer. The amount of correct, incorrect, or unanswered questions is recorded and displayed to the user at the end of the game.
